# Delete-Duplicates

Use this simple and powerful Windows script to delete duplicate files.

Very versatile script !!! Even if you type "a" and press enter, all files containing the letter "a" will get deleted.

If you have let's suppose 1000 files named text_logs_(1).txt, text_logs_(2).txt, and so on until text_logs(1000).txt and 2 files named as readme_text(1).txt and readme_text(2).txt. So if you type "text" in the script and press enter all files containing "text" will get deleted.
